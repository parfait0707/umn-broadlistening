This completes the Python program that replaces the Next.js visualization component in the Kouchou AI project. The program provides an interactive dashboard with the same visualization types as the original:

1. Scatter Plot (All) - Shows top-level clusters in 2D space
2. Scatter Plot (Dense Groups) - Shows only the densest clusters at the deepest level
3. Treemap - Displays the hierarchical structure of opinion clusters

The dashboard includes interactive features like:

- Switching between visualization types
- Adjusting density and minimum value filters for dense clusters
- Toggling cluster labels
- Navigating the treemap hierarchy
- Fullscreen mode

You can run the program in two modes:

1. Dashboard mode (interactive web interface)
2. Export mode (generates static HTML files)

To use the program, you would run it with a command like:

```shell:shell
python kouchou_visualization.py --data path/to/result.json --mode dashboard --port 8050  
```
Or to export static HTML files:
```shell:shell
python kouchou_visualization.py --data path/to/result.json --mode export --output output_folder  
```

Notes:

- The program requires the following Python packages: json, os, argparse, numpy, pandas, plotly, dash, and dash-bootstrap-components.
- The dashboard is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- The treemap visualization allows for interactive exploration of the hierarchical cluster structure.
